# INTERFACING-OF-ADC-WITH-ARM-PROCESSOR

# AIM: 
   To interface and toggle the led with ARM LPC 1768 microprocessor           
           
# COMPONENTS REQUIRED:

## Hardware:
ARM LPC1343 / LPC1768
LCD module
## Software:
Coocox IDE

# PROCEDURE:
```
Step 1: Go to start All programs  COIDE.
Step 2: Give a suitable file name for your project and give the destination folder and then next. Step 3: Go to chip NXP LPC 13XX  LPC1343  Next.
Step 4: Select the required library file (SYSCON and GPIO) from the repository. Step 5: A new project will be created.
Step 6: Double click on main.c and type the program.
Step 7: Add the required library source file to the project (Right click on include Add file to group and
add the source file).
Step 8: Build the program using build option.
Step 9: Flash the program by clicking on download code to flash. Step 10: Interface the required component and note down the output. ADD FILES:

Repository:
CMSIS core, CMSIS boot, common header files, SYSCON, GPIO.

# Source files:
simple example.c, Uart Receiver interrupt.c, lcd.c, lcd.h

# PROGRAM:
```c++
#include"lcd.h" 
void ADCExp(); 
int main(void)
{
ReceiverInterrupt(); 
init_lcd();
lcd_putstring(LINE1, "RAANA ADC DEMO "); 
ADCExp();
while(1)
{
}
}
```
# OUTPUT:
<img width="558" height="375" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43724009-8749-424c-934a-9600e558e026" />


 
# RESULTS:
Thus, an embedded c program to interface ADC with ARM processor was executed and output 
was verified successfully
